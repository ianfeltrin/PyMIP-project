# PyMIP - Python Medical Image Processing
Learning the fundamentals of Medical Image Processing with Python by analyzing X-ray images.


## üöÄ About the project

This is a learning project focused on the fundamentals of Medical Image Processing using Python. The objective is to explore image manipulation and analysis techniques, from basic pixel operations to the segmentation of Regions of Interest (ROI).

This repository documents my learning journey and the practical challenges developed.

## ‚ú® Features

At the moment, the scripts in this repository are capable of:
* **Load and Display images:** Reading various image formats and displaying them with Matplotlib.
* **Pixels manipulation:** Adjusting brightness/contrast, creating image negatives, and cropping regions.
* **Local manipulation:** Applying effects to specific areas of the image.

## üõ†Ô∏è Libraries used

* **Language:** Python
* **Main Libraries:**
    * OpenCV-Python
    * NumPy
    * Matplotlib

## üîÆ Next steps (Roadmap)

* [ ] Implement contrast enhancement filters (Histogram Equalization).
* [ ] Explore automatic image segmentation techniques.
* [ ] Introduce Machine Learning algorithms for diagnostic classification.
